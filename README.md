# OutageMapper

The purpose of this web application is to simulate internet and cable outages in the continental United States. This project was made to simulate scenarios (to the best of our ability) so that we can gain some experience troubleshooting hybrid fiber coaxial cable networks. While this is not a one-to-one simulation of real world outages, we believe that this site gives us insight into how real world scenarios could be handled.
